# Tutorial for Hardware Interrupts with the Xilinx Zynq Platform Using Linux

## About
This tutorial explains how to generate interrupts with the Xilinx Zynq
platform within programmable logic and processing them in the Linux kernel using
 a device driver. A 
'quick start' is provided, including required code snippets and a short description how to
use them. 

## Structure
The directories 'appl', 'driver', 'dts' and 'system' are related to the
demonstrator system. These directories contain a user space program for
configuring the hardware timer, the Linux driver, devicetree source file and the
hardware system.

Use the toplevel Makefile to build the subdirectories or use the one of the
respective directory.
